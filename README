This program performs a Monte Carlo simulation to calculate pi when given a number of digits to obtain after the decimal point and the number of simulations to run and average. The program uses either single or double precision datatypes. Usage is:

./5A <digits of precision> <number of simulations to average> <any value for single precision, double precision is default>
